# Chapter-state redesign — what changed

Five commits (phases A–E) plus this cleanup. Your data is upgraded automatically
the first time the Dossier opens. Nothing was deleted: every replaced value was
copied into a `legacy*` field (listed below) so you can decide later what to drop.

## The big idea

Almost everything about a character now lives **on each chapter** (snapshot).
A new chapter starts as a copy of the chapter you were on; you edit only what
changed, and changed sections get an amber **CHANGED** dot (new entries get a
green **NEW** tag).

| Fixed (whole character) | Per chapter |
|---|---|
| name, faction, muses, glyph | archetype, location, objective, heading toward |
| divine status, God / primordial, authority | relationships, knowledge, secrets |
| | condition, notes, marks |
| | inventory (with item marks and binding) |
| | skills, titles, stats, emotional state |
| | chapter range, blurb, backstory, portrait, generated-portrait settings |
| | locked (canon) or draft |

## What moved where

| Before | Now |
|---|---|
| Storyline (race) | **Archetype**, per chapter, picked from `assets/archetypes.js` or written by hand. Shows `UNASSIGNED` when empty. Race is gone. |
| Mythos: Blessed / Cursed | **Marks** (blessing / curse / binding) on the Marks tab. Old value became one mark named "Blessed (migrated)" or "Cursed (migrated)" on every chapter. |
| Blessed/Cursed rank names (Dormant…Divine, Beast…Titan) | Titles show a plain **Tier 1–7**. |
| Story Arc panel (objective, arc, development, turning points, completed, direction) | **Arc tab**: archetype timeline built from the chapters + one **Heading toward** line. Objective is on the **Chapter** tab. |
| Relationships, knowledge, secrets (whole character) | Per chapter (Ties and Knowledge tabs). |
| Generation section (field ledger, pending/confirm/reject, ✦ Generate, keyboard log) | **Chapter Brief**: read-only summary of the active chapter, **Copy brief** button, chapter strip, and **Lock as canon / Reopen to edit**. |
| Generation → Current Location | Chapter location (Chapter tab → Edit chapter, or Edit whole sheet). Same Era → Continent → Country → City → Special Site picker. |
| Generation → Objectives / Injuries | Chapter objective / condition. |
| Generation → other committed entries | Chapter notes, as lines starting `[from Generation: <field>]`. |
| Generation chapter "committed" | Chapter `locked: true` (canon). Locked chapters can't be edited or deleted until reopened. |
| Generated-portrait figure / style / seed (whole character) | Per chapter, so re-rolling one chapter no longer changes the others. |
| Storybook `open lib` (Generation entries) | Shows the chapter brief. |

**Gods and primordials** (any divine status, or the God / primordial box) use the
divine archetype list and keep **one archetype for every chapter**; changing it
anywhere changes it everywhere. It can't change while any of their chapters is
locked.

**Atlas** reads each chapter's `location` and `objective`. For chapters saved before
locations existed it falls back to the old Generation ledger (`legacyGenerationStates*`).

**Portrait generator**: the look now comes from divine status / primordial, the
Voided faction, and the chapter's blessing/curse marks. Angel/demon looks from the
old storyline text are gone.

## New pieces

- `assets/archetypes.js` — the archetype list (data only; the one place to rename entries).
- System sheet tabs: **Chapter** (new, first), **Marks** (new), Stats, Skills, Inventory, Ties, Arc (rebuilt), Knowledge.
- Mark shape: `{ id, kind: 'blessing'|'curse'|'binding', name, source, effect, cost, ends }`. Costs are text only; the site never applies them.
- Inventory items: `marks: [Mark]`, `boundTo: string`.
- State: `schemaVersion` (now 5). Upgrades run once, in order: v2 per-chapter state, v3 chapter-only lists, v4 archetype/marks, v5 brief + locks.

## Legacy fields (kept, not shown)

Drop any of these whenever you're happy nothing is missing. Fields marked
*Latest* only exist if you edited that value after the first upgrade.

### On each character

| Field | Holds |
|---|---|
| `legacyStoryline` | The old Storyline (race) text. |
| `legacyStorylineLatest` | Storyline if edited after the first upgrade. |
| `legacyMythos` | The old mythos: `''`, `'Blessed'` or `'Cursed'`. |
| `legacyMythosLatest` | Mythos if changed after the first upgrade. |
| `legacyStoryArc` | The whole old Story Arc: `currentObjective`, `currentArc`, `currentDevelopment`, `majorTurningPoints`, `completedDevelopments`, `direction`. |
| `legacyStoryArcLatest` | Story Arc if edited after the first upgrade. |
| `legacyRelationships` | Whole-character relationships before they became per chapter (they were also copied into every chapter). |
| `legacyKnowledge` | Whole-character knowledge (also copied into every chapter). |
| `legacySecrets` | Whole-character secrets (also copied into every chapter). |
| `legacyPortraitFigure`, `legacyPortraitStyle`, `legacyPortraitSeed` | Generated-portrait settings before they moved onto each chapter (also copied into every chapter). |

**Before dropping `legacyStoryline` or `legacyMythos`:** the portrait generator uses
them as part of each generated portrait's random seed, so existing generated
portraits keep their figure. Removing them changes those portraits. Uploaded
portraits are not affected.

### On the saved state

| Field | Holds |
|---|---|
| `legacyGenerationStates` | The full Generation ledger (every entry, including pending and rejected) at the first upgrade. |
| `legacyGenerationStatesLatest` | The ledger as it stood when the brief replaced it, if it changed after the first upgrade. |

### Browser storage

| Key | Holds |
|---|---|
| `epitaph-character-profiles-backup-v1` | An untouched copy of all your data from before the first upgrade. It doubles storage use; if the site ever says storage is full, Export a backup file, then this key is the first thing to remove. |

## Removed code

Generation ledger UI and its pending/confirm/reject logic, the ✦ Generate stub
(`window.prompt`), keyboard-only log controls, the transitional
Generation→chapter sync, the old location cascade, story-arc form helpers, rank
tracks, mythos selects, the unused mini-window summaries, and their CSS. Cache
keys bumped: `epitaph-theme.css?v=8`, `portrait-gen.js?v=8`, `archetypes.js?v=1`.
